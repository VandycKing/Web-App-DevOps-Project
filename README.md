## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage
To run the application, you first need to containerize it. You can do this by using the following command to build an image of the app:

```bash
docker build -t <name-of-the-image> .
```
This command creates a Docker image with the specified name (<name-of-the-image>) using the current directory as the build context. Once the image is built, you can run the app in a container with the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 <name of the image>
``` 
This command starts a Docker container based on the previously built image, mapping port 5000 on your local machine to port 5000 in the container. Once the container starts you should be able to access the application locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.

- **Containerization:** Docker is employed to build and package all dependencies of the application into a docker image,and run the application in a container to make it consistency across different platforms.

- **Networking:** Terraform is employed to provision networking services for AKS. This involved creating a networking module and creating a resource gorup, virtual network, subnets for the control plane and worker nodes, network security group (NSG) and NSG rules to allow inbound traffic for kube-apiserver and ssh.
